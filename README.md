the gateway is a communication bridge between IoT and the upper application. On the one hand, it needs to receive and analyze data from IoT, then send processed data to different application server. On the other hand, it needs to receive search or control request from applications,then send corresponding command to IoT device. The gateway node downward uses serial port to connect to root node of WSN, while uses WiFi to keep communication with RFID sysytem, and upward communicate with Internet via WAN technology.This gateway software systems  development work includes the following aspects: (1) impelements of heterogeneous network convergence gateway communication protocol, supporting interaction and handling heterogeneous data of WSN and RFID systems ; (2) Encapsulate IoT data as data service that provides RESTful Web Service interface to the upper application, easy for use or redevelopmentl; (3) Support timing data reporting, real-time data extraction, event data request three services model (4) Data stream's speed match, Data cache handle, Device status detection mechanism, etc.
